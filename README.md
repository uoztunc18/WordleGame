Wordle is a simple game in which you have to guess a new five-letter word in maximum six trials.

1. Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green.
2. Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow. 
3. Letters that are not in the answer turn gray.
4. Letters can appear more than once. So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green.
5. Each guess must be a valid word in Wordle's dictionary. You can't guess ABCDE, for instance.
